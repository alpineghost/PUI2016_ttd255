##Homework 2

###For assignment 1 and 2: 
I created two following files: show_bus_locations.py and get_bus_info.py on my local machine and pushed them into my repository PUI2016_ttd255 in the folder HW2_ttd255 (Link: ). In these two assignments, I used Professor Bianco's codes for fetching data from an URL address into json format. The code is listed in the jupyternotebook with the following link: https://github.com/fedhere/UInotebooks/blob/master/dataWrangling/PandasDataWrangling-Chap7.ipynb.

###For assignment 3 and extra credit: 
I generated two jupyternotebooks on compute in the following directory: https://localhost:8000/user/ttd255/tree/homedirs/ttd255/PUI2016_ttd255/HW2_ttd255. I then downloaded them to my local computer and pushed them to my remote repository on github, PUI2016_ttd255 in the folder HW2_ttd255 as I did with the previous two assignments
