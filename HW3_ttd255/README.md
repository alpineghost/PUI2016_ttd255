##Homework 3

###Assignment 1

I created 100 samples for each of the following distributions: Chi square, Normal, Poison, Binomial, and Exponential distributions. I then create the scatter and histogram plot for each type of distributuon.
I plotted all the sample mean values of all the five distributions in one histogram plot and fit a gaussian to this distribution of mean values.

###Assignment 2

I picked the month February of 2015 as my data sample.
My hypothesis is given in more detail in the Hw3_Assignment2.ipynb file.
I also draw a graph to illustrate my hypothesis but more tests will be executed on the next assignment.

###Assignment 3

I did the z-test for my hypothesis comparing the average commute time of the new bus route with that of the old bus route.
The result and my conclusion about the null hypothesis are provided in Hw3_Assignment3.ipynb file.
